OpenGraph for Java is a small class used to represent the
Open Graph protocol (available from Packages
http://opengraphprotocol.org/) No packages published
This project is entirely open source due to the size of the
code, so please go nuts and do whatever you want with
the code. Contributors 4
Due to the lack of useful native DOM parsers this class Be.) callumj Callum Jones

johndeverall John Deverall
http://htmicleaner.sourceforge.net/index. php), please find
the license for it at the bottom of this readme. There is the @ rkhmelyuk Ruslan khmelyuk
hope to remove reliance on third party libraries at a later
stage. @ niallkennedy Niall Kennedy
@ Usage
Languages
In this example we will fetch the og:title and og:type
————
contents, while ignoring any errors if this page does not ‘© Java 100.0%
comply with the Open Graph protocol standard (set in the
constructor via true)
OpenGraph testPage = new
OpenGraph("http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/121770
O-kick_ass", true);
String title = testPage.getContent("title");
String type = testPage.getContent("type");
Another example (available in the examples/ folder)
demonstrates the support for custom OpenGraph
namespaces
OpenGraph movie = new OpenGraph("http://www.rotte
system.out.printin("Novie: " + movie.getContent("
for (MetaElement director : movie.getProperties("
{
OpenGraph extendedInfo = director.getexte
system.out.printin("Directed by: " + exte
r
for (MetaElement member : movie.getProperties("ca
{
OpenGraph extendedInfo = member .getExtend
system.out.printIn("Starring: " + extende
r
@ Features
+ Uses the correct charset of the page during parsing
(thanks to rkhmelyuk)
+ Support's the ability for social applications to declare
their own namespaces and OpenGraph meta
+ Hashtable like representation of an Open Graph page
+ Output to HTML (render the meta data back out as
tags)
+ Create OG data from scratch (the ability to use this
class as a reverse and generate OG meta tags)
