Background [edit]
“Dublin” refers to Dublin, Ohio, USA where the schema originated during the 1995 invitational
OCLCINCSA Metadata Workshop, ""! hosted by the OCLC (known at that time as Online
Computer Library Center), a library consortium based in Dublin, and the National Center for
‘Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). "Core" refers to the metadata terms as "broad and generic
being usable for describing a wide range of resources"."©! The semantics of Dublin Core were
established and are maintained by an international, cross-disciplinary group of professionals from
librarianship, computer science, text encoding, museums, and other related fields of scholarship
and practice.
In 1999, the first Dublin Core encoding standard was in HTML. a Starting in 2000, the Dublin Core
community focused on “application profiles" — the idea that metadata records would use Dublin
Core together with other specialized vocabularies to meet particular implementation requirements.
During that time, the World Wide Web Consortium’s work on a generic data model for metadata,
the Resource Description Framework (RDF), was maturing. As part of an extended set of DCMI
metadata terms, Dublin Core became one of the most popular vocabularies for use with RDF,
more recently in the context of the linked data movement.)
The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI)'”! provides an open forum for the development of
interoperable online metadata standards for a broad range of purposes and of business models.
DCMs activities include consensus-driven working groups, global conferences and workshops,
standards liaison, and educational efforts to promote widespread acceptance of metadata
standards and practices. In 2008, DCMI separated from OCLC and incorporated as an
independent entity.2°)
Currently, any and all changes that are made to the Dublin Core standard, are reviewed by a
DCMI Usage Board within the context of a DCMI Namespace Policy (DCMI-NAMESPACE). This
policy describes how terms are assigned and also sets limits on the amount of editorial changes
allowed to the labels, definitions, and usage comments.)
Levels of the standard [ecit}
The Dublin Core standard originally included two levels: Simple and Qualified. Simple Dublin Core
comprised 15 elements; Qualified Dublin Core included three additional elements (Audience,
Provenance and RightsHolder), as well as a group of element refinements (also called qualifiers)
that could refine the semantics of the elements in ways that may be useful in resource discovery.
‘Since 2012, the two have been incorporated into the DCM! Metadata Terms as a single set of
terms using the RDF data model.2! The full set of elements is found under the namespace
http:(ipurl.org/delterms/«®. Because the definition of the terms often contains domains and ranges,
which may not be compatible with the pre-RDF definitions used for the original 15 Dublin Core
elements, there is a separate namespace for the original 15 elements as previously defined:
http://purl.org/dclelements/1.1/@.25)
Dublin Core Metadata Element Set [ecit]
The original DCMES Version 1.1 consists of 15 metadata elements, defined this way in the
original specification:!°14
1. Contributor — "An entity responsible for making contributions to the resource”.
2. Coverage — "The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, the spatial applicability of the
resource, or the jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant’
3. Creator ~ "An entity primarily responsible for making the resource”
4. Date ~ "A point or period of time associated with an event in the lifecycle of the resource”.
5. Description — "An account of the resource".
6. Format — "The file format, physical medium, or dimensions of the resource”.
7. Identifier — "An unambiguous reference to the resource within a given context”.
8. Language — "A language of the resource".
9. Publisher ~ "An entity responsible for making the resource available”.
10. Relation - "A related resource”.
111. Rights — "Information about rights held in and over the resource”.
12. Source —"A related resource from which the described resource is derived”.
13. Subject — "The topic of the resource".
14. Title — "A name given to the resource".
15. Type - "The nature or genre of the resource".
Each Dublin Core element is optional and may be repeated. The DCMI has established standard
ways to refine elements and encourage the use of encoding and vocabulary schemes. There is no
prescribed order in Dublin Core for presenting or using the elements. The Dublin Core became a
NISO standards, 239.85, and IETF RFC 5013 in 2007, ISO 15836 standard in 2009 and is used
as a base-level data element set for the description of learning resources in the ISO/IEC 19788-2
Metadata for learning resources (MLR) — Part 2: Dublin Core elements, prepared by the ISO/IEC
JTC USC 36.
Full information on element definitions and term relationships can be found in the Dublin Core
Metadata Registry.{5)
Encoding examples [edit]

Example of use [and mention] by WebCite [ e«it]
On the “archive form" web page for WebCite it says,""®! in part: "Metadata (optional): These are
Dublin Core elements. [...’
Qualified Dublin Core {ecit]
(Superseded in 2008 by the DCMI Metadata Terms.'""!) Subsequent to the specification of the
original 15 elements, an ongoing process to develop exemplary terms extending or refining the
DCMES was begun. The additional terms were identified, generally in working groups of the
DCMI, and judged by the DCMI Usage Board to be in conformance with principles of good
practice for the qualification of Dublin Core metadata elements.
Element refinements make the meaning of an element narrower or more specific. A refined
element shares the meaning of the unqualified element, but with a more restricted scope. The
guiding principle for the qualification of Dublin Core elements, colloquially known as the Dumb-
Down Principle,""®! states that an application that does not understand a specific element
refinement term should be able to ignore the qualifier and treat the metadata value as if it were an
unqualified (broader) element. While this may result in some loss of specificity, the remaining
element value (without the qualifier) should continue to be generally correct and useful for
discovery.
In addition to element refinements, Qualified Dublin Core includes a set of recommended
encoding schemes, designed to aid in the interpretation of an element value. These schemes
include controlled vocabularies and formal notations or parsing rules. A value expressed using an
encoding scheme may thus be a token selected from a controlled vocabulary (for example, a term
from a classification system or set of subject headings) or a string formatted in accordance with a
formal notation, for example, "2000-12-31" as the ISO standard expression of a date. If an
encoding scheme is not understood by an application, the value may stil be useful to a human
reader.
Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder are elements, but not part of the Simple Dublin Core 15
elements. Use Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder only when using Qualified Dublin Core.
DCMI also maintains a small, general vocabulary recommended for use within the element Type.
This vocabulary currently consists of 12 terms.!15]
DCMI Metadata Terms [ccit)
The DCMI Metadata Terms lists the current set of the Dublin Core vocabulary.! This set includes
the fifteen terms of the DCMES (in italic), as well as the qualified terms. Each term has a unique
URI in the namespace htip://purl.org/delterms®, and all are defined as RDF properties.

Syntax [edit]
Syntax choices for metadata expressed with the Dublin Core elements depend on context. Dublin
Core concepts and semantics are designed to be syntax independent!=!="eation needed) and apply
to a variety of contexts, as long as the metadata is in a form suitable for interpretation by both
machines and people.
The Dublin Core Abstract Model!*"! provides a reference model against which particular Dublin
Core encoding guidelines can be compared, independent of any particular encoding syntax. Such
a reference model helps implementers get a better understanding of the kinds of descriptions they
are trying to encode and facilitates the development of better mappings and translations between
different syntaxes.
Notable applications [ecit)
One Document Type Definition based on Dublin Core is the Open Source Metadata Framework
(OMF) specification.2°! OMF is in turn used by Rarian (superseding ScrollKeeper), which is used
by the GNOME desktop and KDE help browsers and the ScrollServer documentation server.
PBCore is also based on Dublin Core. The Zope CMF's Metadata products, used by the Plone,
ERP5, the Nuxeo CPS Content management systems, SimpleDL, and Fedora Commons also
implement Dublin Core. The EPUB e-book format uses Dublin Core metadata in the OPF file.!221
The Australian Government Locator Service (AGLS) metadata standard is an application profile of
Dublin Core.25!5

Background [edit]
“Dublin” refers to Dublin, Ohio, USA where the schema originated during the 1995 invitational
OCLCINCSA Metadata Workshop, ""! hosted by the OCLC (known at that time as Online
Computer Library Center), a library consortium based in Dublin, and the National Center for
‘Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). "Core" refers to the metadata terms as "broad and generic
being usable for describing a wide range of resources"."©! The semantics of Dublin Core were
established and are maintained by an international, cross-disciplinary group of professionals from
librarianship, computer science, text encoding, museums, and other related fields of scholarship
and practice.
In 1999, the first Dublin Core encoding standard was in HTML. a Starting in 2000, the Dublin Core
community focused on “application profiles" — the idea that metadata records would use Dublin
Core together with other specialized vocabularies to meet particular implementation requirements.
During that time, the World Wide Web Consortium’s work on a generic data model for metadata,
the Resource Description Framework (RDF), was maturing. As part of an extended set of DCMI
metadata terms, Dublin Core became one of the most popular vocabularies for use with RDF,
more recently in the context of the linked data movement.)
The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI)'”! provides an open forum for the development of
interoperable online metadata standards for a broad range of purposes and of business models.
DCMs activities include consensus-driven working groups, global conferences and workshops,
standards liaison, and educational efforts to promote widespread acceptance of metadata
standards and practices. In 2008, DCMI separated from OCLC and incorporated as an
independent entity.2°)
Currently, any and all changes that are made to the Dublin Core standard, are reviewed by a
DCMI Usage Board within the context of a DCMI Namespace Policy (DCMI-NAMESPACE). This
policy describes how terms are assigned and also sets limits on the amount of editorial changes
allowed to the labels, definitions, and usage comments.)
Levels of the standard [ecit}
The Dublin Core standard originally included two levels: Simple and Qualified. Simple Dublin Core
comprised 15 elements; Qualified Dublin Core included three additional elements (Audience,
Provenance and RightsHolder), as well as a group of element refinements (also called qualifiers)
that could refine the semantics of the elements in ways that may be useful in resource discovery.
‘Since 2012, the two have been incorporated into the DCM! Metadata Terms as a single set of
terms using the RDF data model.2! The full set of elements is found under the namespace
http:(ipurl.org/delterms/«®. Because the definition of the terms often contains domains and ranges,
which may not be compatible with the pre-RDF definitions used for the original 15 Dublin Core
elements, there is a separate namespace for the original 15 elements as previously defined:
http://purl.org/dclelements/1.1/@.25)
Dublin Core Metadata Element Set [ecit]
The original DCMES Version 1.1 consists of 15 metadata elements, defined this way in the
original specification:!°14
1. Contributor — "An entity responsible for making contributions to the resource”.
2. Coverage — "The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, the spatial applicability of the
resource, or the jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant’
3. Creator ~ "An entity primarily responsible for making the resource”
4. Date ~ "A point or period of time associated with an event in the lifecycle of the resource”.
5. Description — "An account of the resource".
6. Format — "The file format, physical medium, or dimensions of the resource”.
7. Identifier — "An unambiguous reference to the resource within a given context”.
8. Language — "A language of the resource".
9. Publisher ~ "An entity responsible for making the resource available”.
10. Relation - "A related resource”.
111. Rights — "Information about rights held in and over the resource”.
12. Source —"A related resource from which the described resource is derived”.
13. Subject — "The topic of the resource".
14. Title — "A name given to the resource".
15. Type - "The nature or genre of the resource".
Each Dublin Core element is optional and may be repeated. The DCMI has established standard
ways to refine elements and encourage the use of encoding and vocabulary schemes. There is no
prescribed order in Dublin Core for presenting or using the elements. The Dublin Core became a
NISO standards, 239.85, and IETF RFC 5013 in 2007, ISO 15836 standard in 2009 and is used
as a base-level data element set for the description of learning resources in the ISO/IEC 19788-2

Background [edit]
“Dublin” refers to Dublin, Ohio, USA where the schema originated during the 1995 invitational
OCLCINCSA Metadata Workshop, ""! hosted by the OCLC (known at that time as Online
Computer Library Center), a library consortium based in Dublin, and the National Center for
‘Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). "Core" refers to the metadata terms as "broad and generic
being usable for describing a wide range of resources"."©! The semantics of Dublin Core were
established and are maintained by an international, cross-disciplinary group of professionals from
librarianship, computer science, text encoding, museums, and other related fields of scholarship
and practice.
In 1999, the first Dublin Core encoding standard was in HTML. a Starting in 2000, the Dublin Core
community focused on “application profiles" — the idea that metadata records would use Dublin
Core together with other specialized vocabularies to meet particular implementation requirements.
During that time, the World Wide Web Consortium’s work on a generic data model for metadata,
the Resource Description Framework (RDF), was maturing. As part of an extended set of DCMI
metadata terms, Dublin Core became one of the most popular vocabularies for use with RDF,
more recently in the context of the linked data movement.)
The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI)'”! provides an open forum for the development of
interoperable online metadata standards for a broad range of purposes and of business models.
DCMs activities include consensus-driven working groups, global conferences and workshops,
standards liaison, and educational efforts to promote widespread acceptance of metadata
standards and practices. In 2008, DCMI separated from OCLC and incorporated as an
independent entity.2°)
Currently, any and all changes that are made to the Dublin Core standard, are reviewed by a
DCMI Usage Board within the context of a DCMI Namespace Policy (DCMI-NAMESPACE). This
policy describes how terms are assigned and also sets limits on the amount of editorial changes
allowed to the labels, definitions, and usage comments.)
Levels of the standard [ecit}
The Dublin Core standard originally included two levels: Simple and Qualified. Simple Dublin Core
comprised 15 elements; Qualified Dublin Core included three additional elements (Audience,
Provenance and RightsHolder), as well as a group of element refinements (also called qualifiers)
that could refine the semantics of the elements in ways that may be useful in resource discovery.
‘Since 2012, the two have been incorporated into the DCM! Metadata Terms as a single set of
terms using the RDF data model.2! The full set of elements is found under the namespace
http:(ipurl.org/delterms/«®. Because the definition of the terms often contains domains and ranges,
which may not be compatible with the pre-RDF definitions used for the original 15 Dublin Core
elements, there is a separate namespace for the original 15 elements as previously defined:
http://purl.org/dclelements/1.1/@.25)
Dublin Core Metadata Element Set [ecit]
The original DCMES Version 1.1 consists of 15 metadata elements, defined this way in the
original specification:!°14
1. Contributor — "An entity responsible for making contributions to the resource”.
2. Coverage — "The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, the spatial applicability of the
resource, or the jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant’
3. Creator ~ "An entity primarily responsible for making the resource”
4. Date ~ "A point or period of time associated with an event in the lifecycle of the resource”.
5. Description — "An account of the resource".
6. Format — "The file format, physical medium, or dimensions of the resource”.
7. Identifier — "An unambiguous reference to the resource within a given context”.
8. Language — "A language of the resource".
9. Publisher ~ "An entity responsible for making the resource available”.
10. Relation - "A related resource”.
111. Rights — "Information about rights held in and over the resource”.
12. Source —"A related resource from which the described resource is derived”.
13. Subject — "The topic of the resource".
14. Title — "A name given to the resource".
15. Type - "The nature or genre of the resource".
Each Dublin Core element is optional and may be repeated. The DCMI has established standard
ways to refine elements and encourage the use of encoding and vocabulary schemes. There is no
prescribed order in Dublin Core for presenting or using the elements. The Dublin Core became a
NISO standards, 239.85, and IETF RFC 5013 in 2007, ISO 15836 standard in 2009 and is used
as a base-level data element set for the description of learning resources in the ISO/IEC 19788-2
Metadata for learning resources (MLR) — Part 2: Dublin Core elements, prepared by the ISO/IEC
JTC USC 36.
Full information on element definitions and term relationships can be found in the Dublin Core
Metadata Registry.{5)
Encoding examples [edit]
<meta name="DC.Format" content="video/mpeg; 10 minutes" />
<meta name="DC.Language" content="en" />
<meta name="DC.Publisher" content="publisher-name" />
<meta name="DC.Title" content="HYP" />
Example of use [and mention] by WebCite [ e«it]
On the “archive form" web page for WebCite it says,""®! in part: "Metadata (optional): These are
Dublin Core elements. [...’
Qualified Dublin Core {ecit]
(Superseded in 2008 by the DCMI Metadata Terms.'""!) Subsequent to the specification of the
original 15 elements, an ongoing process to develop exemplary terms extending or refining the
DCMES was begun. The additional terms were identified, generally in working groups of the
DCMI, and judged by the DCMI Usage Board to be in conformance with principles of good
practice for the qualification of Dublin Core metadata elements.
Element refinements make the meaning of an element narrower or more specific. A refined
element shares the meaning of the unqualified element, but with a more restricted scope. The
guiding principle for the qualification of Dublin Core elements, colloquially known as the Dumb-
Down Principle,""®! states that an application that does not understand a specific element
refinement term should be able to ignore the qualifier and treat the metadata value as if it were an
unqualified (broader) element. While this may result in some loss of specificity, the remaining
element value (without the qualifier) should continue to be generally correct and useful for
discovery.
In addition to element refinements, Qualified Dublin Core includes a set of recommended
encoding schemes, designed to aid in the interpretation of an element value. These schemes
include controlled vocabularies and formal notations or parsing rules. A value expressed using an
encoding scheme may thus be a token selected from a controlled vocabulary (for example, a term
from a classification system or set of subject headings) or a string formatted in accordance with a
formal notation, for example, "2000-12-31" as the ISO standard expression of a date. If an
encoding scheme is not understood by an application, the value may stil be useful to a human
reader.
Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder are elements, but not part of the Simple Dublin Core 15
elements. Use Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder only when using Qualified Dublin Core.
DCMI also maintains a small, general vocabulary recommended for use within the element Type.
This vocabulary currently consists of 12 terms.!15]
DCMI Metadata Terms [ccit)
The DCMI Metadata Terms lists the current set of the Dublin Core vocabulary.! This set includes
the fifteen terms of the DCMES (in italic), as well as the qualified terms. Each term has a unique
URI in the namespace htip://purl.org/delterms®, and all are defined as RDF properties.

Syntax [edit]
Syntax choices for metadata expressed with the Dublin Core elements depend on context. Dublin
Core concepts and semantics are designed to be syntax independent!=!="eation needed) and apply
to a variety of contexts, as long as the metadata is in a form suitable for interpretation by both
machines and people.
The Dublin Core Abstract Model!*"! provides a reference model against which particular Dublin
Core encoding guidelines can be compared, independent of any particular encoding syntax. Such
a reference model helps implementers get a better understanding of the kinds of descriptions they
are trying to encode and facilitates the development of better mappings and translations between
different syntaxes.
Notable applications [ecit)
One Document Type Definition based on Dublin Core is the Open Source Metadata Framework
(OMF) specification.2°! OMF is in turn used by Rarian (superseding ScrollKeeper), which is used
by the GNOME desktop and KDE help browsers and the ScrollServer documentation server.
PBCore is also based on Dublin Core. The Zope CMF's Metadata products, used by the Plone,
ERP5, the Nuxeo CPS Content management systems, SimpleDL, and Fedora Commons also
implement Dublin Core. The EPUB e-book format uses Dublin Core metadata in the OPF file.!221
The Australian Government Locator Service (AGLS) metadata standard is an application profile of
Dublin Core.25!5

Background [edit]
“Dublin” refers to Dublin, Ohio, USA where the schema originated during the 1995 invitational
OCLCINCSA Metadata Workshop, ""! hosted by the OCLC (known at that time as Online
Computer Library Center), a library consortium based in Dublin, and the National Center for
‘Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). "Core" refers to the metadata terms as "broad and generic
being usable for describing a wide range of resources"."©! The semantics of Dublin Core were
established and are maintained by an international, cross-disciplinary group of professionals from
librarianship, computer science, text encoding, museums, and other related fields of scholarship
and practice.
In 1999, the first Dublin Core encoding standard was in HTML. a Starting in 2000, the Dublin Core
community focused on “application profiles" — the idea that metadata records would use Dublin
Core together with other specialized vocabularies to meet particular implementation requirements.
During that time, the World Wide Web Consortium’s work on a generic data model for metadata,
the Resource Description Framework (RDF), was maturing. As part of an extended set of DCMI
metadata terms, Dublin Core became one of the most popular vocabularies for use with RDF,
more recently in the context of the linked data movement.)
The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI)'”! provides an open forum for the development of
interoperable online metadata standards for a broad range of purposes and of business models.
DCMs activities include consensus-driven working groups, global conferences and workshops,
standards liaison, and educational efforts to promote widespread acceptance of metadata
standards and practices. In 2008, DCMI separated from OCLC and incorporated as an
independent entity.2°)
Currently, any and all changes that are made to the Dublin Core standard, are reviewed by a
DCMI Usage Board within the context of a DCMI Namespace Policy (DCMI-NAMESPACE). This
policy describes how terms are assigned and also sets limits on the amount of editorial changes
allowed to the labels, definitions, and usage comments.)
Levels of the standard [ecit}
The Dublin Core standard originally included two levels: Simple and Qualified. Simple Dublin Core
comprised 15 elements; Qualified Dublin Core included three additional elements (Audience,
Provenance and RightsHolder), as well as a group of element refinements (also called qualifiers)
that could refine the semantics of the elements in ways that may be useful in resource discovery.
‘Since 2012, the two have been incorporated into the DCM! Metadata Terms as a single set of
terms using the RDF data model.2! The full set of elements is found under the namespace
http:(ipurl.org/delterms/«®. Because the definition of the terms often contains domains and ranges,
which may not be compatible with the pre-RDF definitions used for the original 15 Dublin Core
elements, there is a separate namespace for the original 15 elements as previously defined:
http://purl.org/dclelements/1.1/@.25)
Dublin Core Metadata Element Set [ecit]
The original DCMES Version 1.1 consists of 15 metadata elements, defined this way in the
original specification:!°14
1. Contributor — "An entity responsible for making contributions to the resource”.
2. Coverage — "The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, the spatial applicability of the
resource, or the jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant’
3. Creator ~ "An entity primarily responsible for making the resource”
4. Date ~ "A point or period of time associated with an event in the lifecycle of the resource”.
5. Description — "An account of the resource".
6. Format — "The file format, physical medium, or dimensions of the resource”.
7. Identifier — "An unambiguous reference to the resource within a given context”.
8. Language — "A language of the resource".
9. Publisher ~ "An entity responsible for making the resource available”.
10. Relation - "A related resource”.
111. Rights — "Information about rights held in and over the resource”.
12. Source —"A related resource from which the described resource is derived”.
13. Subject — "The topic of the resource".
14. Title — "A name given to the resource".
15. Type - "The nature or genre of the resource".
Each Dublin Core element is optional and may be repeated. The DCMI has established standard
ways to refine elements and encourage the use of encoding and vocabulary schemes. There is no
prescribed order in Dublin Core for presenting or using the elements. The Dublin Core became a
NISO standards, 239.85, and IETF RFC 5013 in 2007, ISO 15836 standard in 2009 and is used
as a base-level data element set for the description of learning resources in the ISO/IEC 19788-2
Metadata for learning resources (MLR) — Part 2: Dublin Core elements, prepared by the ISO/IEC
JTC USC 36.
Full information on element definitions and term relationships can be found in the Dublin Core
Metadata Registry.{5)
Encoding examples [edit]
<meta name="DC.Format" content="video/mpeg; 10 minutes" />

<meta name="DC.Publisher" content="publisher-name" />
<meta name="DC.Title" content="HYP" />
Example of use [and mention] by WebCite [ e«it]
On the “archive form" web page for WebCite it says,""®! in part: "Metadata (optional): These are
Dublin Core elements. [...’
Qualified Dublin Core {ecit]
(Superseded in 2008 by the DCMI Metadata Terms.'""!) Subsequent to the specification of the
original 15 elements, an ongoing process to develop exemplary terms extending or refining the
DCMES was begun. The additional terms were identified, generally in working groups of the
DCMI, and judged by the DCMI Usage Board to be in conformance with principles of good
practice for the qualification of Dublin Core metadata elements.
Element refinements make the meaning of an element narrower or more specific. A refined
element shares the meaning of the unqualified element, but with a more restricted scope. The
guiding principle for the qualification of Dublin Core elements, colloquially known as the Dumb-
Down Principle,""®! states that an application that does not understand a specific element
refinement term should be able to ignore the qualifier and treat the metadata value as if it were an
unqualified (broader) element. While this may result in some loss of specificity, the remaining
element value (without the qualifier) should continue to be generally correct and useful for
discovery.
In addition to element refinements, Qualified Dublin Core includes a set of recommended
encoding schemes, designed to aid in the interpretation of an element value. These schemes
include controlled vocabularies and formal notations or parsing rules. A value expressed using an
encoding scheme may thus be a token selected from a controlled vocabulary (for example, a term
from a classification system or set of subject headings) or a string formatted in accordance with a
formal notation, for example, "2000-12-31" as the ISO standard expression of a date. If an
encoding scheme is not understood by an application, the value may stil be useful to a human
reader.
Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder are elements, but not part of the Simple Dublin Core 15
elements. Use Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder only when using Qualified Dublin Core.
DCMI also maintains a small, general vocabulary recommended for use within the element Type.
This vocabulary currently consists of 12 terms.!15]
DCMI Metadata Terms [ccit)
The DCMI Metadata Terms lists the current set of the Dublin Core vocabulary.! This set includes
the fifteen terms of the DCMES (in italic), as well as the qualified terms. Each term has a unique
URI in the namespace htip://purl.org/delterms®, and all are defined as RDF properties.

Syntax [edit]
Syntax choices for metadata expressed with the Dublin Core elements depend on context. Dublin
Core concepts and semantics are designed to be syntax independent!=!="eation needed) and apply
to a variety of contexts, as long as the metadata is in a form suitable for interpretation by both
machines and people.
The Dublin Core Abstract Model!*"! provides a reference model against which particular Dublin
Core encoding guidelines can be compared, independent of any particular encoding syntax. Such
a reference model helps implementers get a better understanding of the kinds of descriptions they
are trying to encode and facilitates the development of better mappings and translations between
different syntaxes.
Notable applications [ecit)
One Document Type Definition based on Dublin Core is the Open Source Metadata Framework
(OMF) specification.2°! OMF is in turn used by Rarian (superseding ScrollKeeper), which is used
by the GNOME desktop and KDE help browsers and the ScrollServer documentation server.
PBCore is also based on Dublin Core. The Zope CMF's Metadata products, used by the Plone,
ERP5, the Nuxeo CPS Content management systems, SimpleDL, and Fedora Commons also
implement Dublin Core. The EPUB e-book format uses Dublin Core metadata in the OPF file.!221
The Australian Government Locator Service (AGLS) metadata standard is an application profile of
Dublin Core.25!5
