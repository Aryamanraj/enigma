Abstract
This specification defines an XHTML document type that is based upon the module framework and
modules defined in XHTML Modularization [XHTMLMOD]. The purpose of this document type is to serve
as the basis for future extended XHTML ‘family’ document types, and to provide a consistent, forward-
looking document type cleanly separated from the deprecated, legacy functionality of HTML 4 [HTML4] that
was brought forward into the XHTML 1.0 [XHTML1] document types. This document type is most similar to
XHTML 1.0 Strict, built using XHTML Modules. This means that many facilities available in other XHTML
Family document types (e.g., XHTML Frames) are not available in this document type. These other
facilities are available through modules defined in XHTML Modularization, and document authors are free
to define document types based upon XHTML 1.1 that use these facilities (see [XHTMLMOD] for
information on creating new document types).
Status of this document
This section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication. Other documents may
supersede this document. A list of current W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report
can be found in the W3C technical reports index at http://www.w3.org/TRY.
This specification is a Superseded Recommendation. A newer specification exists that is recommended for
new adoption in place of this specification.
This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups
and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation.
This document also supersedes the previous edition of XHTML 1.1.
This document has been produced by the W3C XHTML 2 Working Group as part of the HTML Activity.
For purposes of the W3C Patent Policy, this Superseded Recommendation has the same status as an
active Recommendation; it retains licensing commitments and remains available as a reference for old —
and possibly still deployed -- implementations, but is not recommended for future implementation. New
implementations should follow the latest version of the HTML specification
The English version of this specification is the only normative version. Information about translations of this
document is available at http:/www.w3.org/MarkUpitranslations.
