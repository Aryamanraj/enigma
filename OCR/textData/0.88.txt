8 See opengraphprotocol.org for an explanation of what Open Graph Protocol is.
N Ive created three different Open Graph Protocol parsers.
a
Open Graph Protocol to JSON
ARESTIul web service intended for quick page testing (not large-scale/regular use).
RDF-RDFa-Parser
‘An RDFa parsing library for the Perl programming language. This offers shortcuts for parsing
Open Graph Protocol data.
OpenGraphNode.php
Asimple Open Graph Protocol parser for PHP (see below for more info).
OpenGraphNode.php
Latest version: 20110224 (ZIP) (Bzip2)
Installation
Copy OpenGraphNode.php and the "arc" folder to your web server.
Requires PHP 5+. (Version 20100427 supports PHP 4.x.)
Basic Usage
include "OpenGraphNode..php";
# Fetch and parse a URL
#
Spage = "http: //waw.rottentomatoes..com/m/oceans_eleven/";
Snode = new OpenGraphNode(Spage) ;
# Retrieve the title
#
print Snode->title . "\n";  # Like this
print Snode->titte() . "\n"; # or with parentheses
# And obviously the above works for other Open Graph Protocol
# properties like "image", "description", etc. For properties
# that contain a hyphen, you'll need to use underscore instead:
#
print $node->street_address . "\n";
# OpenGraphNode uses PHP5's Iterator feature, so you can
# Loop through it like an array.
#
foreach (Snode as $key => $value) {
print "Skey => $value\n";
t
Advanced Usage
# What if a page has multiple <meta property="og:title"> elenents?
#
Stitles = Snode->title(TRUE); # return an array
print_r(Stitles);
# This gets a key=>value array of all properties.
#
Sall = $node->ALL();
print_r($all);
# And this gets a key=>array of_values array of all properties.
#
Sall = Snode->ALL(TRUE) ;
print_r($all);
# The Open Graph Protocol is based on RDFa, and OpenGraphNode. php
# is powered by a full-fledged RDFa parser. You can access all
# the page's RDFa data if you like!
#
Sdata = Snode->RDFa();
# Return the URL of the page (after following any redirections)
#
Surl = Snode->Base();
