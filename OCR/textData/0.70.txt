Eo Amedia type consists of a type and a subtype, which is further structured into a tree. Amedia
Soo] 1e can optionally define a suffix and parameters:
| a2 more | ‘ps puonaly ps
OO type "/" [tree "."] subtype ["+" suffix]* [";" parameter
ORAS ‘yp C ] ype [ 17 05" pi 1
As of November 1996, the registered types were: application , audio, image,
message , multipart , text and video .”! By December 2020, the registered types
included the foregoing, plus font , example , and model .©!
An unofficial top-level name in common use is chemical .!*II7Ii81
As an example, an HTML file might be designated text/html; charset=UTF-8 . In this
example, text is the type, html is the subtype, and charset=UTF-8 is an optional
parameter indicating the character encoding.
Asubtype typically consists of a media format, but it may or must also contain other content, such
as a tree prefix, producer, product or suffix, according to the different rules in registration trees
‘Types, subtypes, and parameter names are case-insensitive. Parameter values are usually case-
sensitive, but may be interpreted in a case-insensitive fashion depending on the intended use.!

Registration trees [cit]
All media types should be registered using the IANA registration procedures. For the efficiency
and flexibility of the media type registration process, different structures of subtypes can be
registered in registration trees that are distinguished by the use of tree prefixes. Currently the
following trees are created: standard (no prefix), vendor ( vnd._ prefix), personal or vanity
(prs. prefix), unregistered ( x. prefix). These registration trees were first defined in November
1996 (obsoleted RFC 2048 - currently RFC 6838). New registration trees may be created by IETF
Standards Action for external registration and management by well-known permanent
organizations (e.g. scientific societies),
Standards tree [cit]
The standards tree does not use any tree prefix:!12]
type "/" subtype ["+" suffix] *[";" parameter]
Examples: application/javascript , image/png
Registrations in the standards tree must be either associated with IETF specifications approved
directly by the IESG, or registered by an IANA recognized standards-related organization.
Vendor tree [ecit}
The vendor tree includes media types associated with publicly available products. tt uses the
vnd. tree prefix:!2]
type "/" "vnd." subtype ["+" suffix] *[";" parameter]
Examples: application/vnd.ms-excel ,
application/vnd.oasis.opendocument .text
The terms "vendor" and "producer" are considered equivalent in the context. Industry consortia as
well as non-commercial entities can register media types in the vendor tree. A registration in the
vendor tree may be created by anyone who needs to interchange files associated with some
software product or set of products. However, the registration belongs to the vendor or
organization producing the software that employs the type being registered, and that vendor or
organization can at any time elect to assert ownership of a registration done by a third party.
Personal or vanity tree [ eit)
The personal or vanity tree includes media types associated with non publicly available products
or experimental media types. It uses the prs. tree prefix:
type "/" "prs." subtype ["+" suffix] *[";" parameter]
Examples: audio/prs.sid, image/prs.btif .
Unregistered tree [cit]
The unregistered tree includes media types intended exclusively for use in private environments
and only with the active agreement of the parties exchanging them. It uses the x. tree prefix:
type "/" "x." subtype ["+" suffix] *[";" parameter]
Examples: application/x.foo , video/x.bar .
Media types in this tree cannot be registered. According to RFC 6838 (published in January
2013), any use of types in the unregistered tree is strongly discouraged. in addition, subtypes
prefixed with x- or X- are no longer considered to be members of this tree.
According to obsoleted RFC 2048 (published in November 1996)—it should rarely, if ever, be
necessary to use unregistered types, and as such use of any x. , x- or X- prefixes is
discouraged. Obsoleted RFC 1590 (published in September 1993) stated that the use of the x-
or X- prefix may be used for unregistered subtypes.
Media types that have been widely deployed (with a subtype prefixed with x- or X- ) without
being registered, should be, if possible, re-registered with a proper prefixed subtype. If this is not
possible, the media type can, after an approval by both the media types reviewer and the IESG,
be registered in the standards tree with its unprefixed subtype.
Suffix [edit]
Suffix is an augmentation to the media type definition to additionally specify the underlying
structure of that media type, allowing for generic processing based on that structure and
independent of the exact type’s particular semantics. Media types that make use of a named
structured syntax should use the appropriate IANA registered "+"suffix for that structured
syntax when they are registered. Unregistered suffixes should not be used (since January 2013).
Structured syntax suffix registration procedures are defined in RFC 6838.02)
The +xm1_ suffix has been defined since January 2001 (RFC 3023"5!), and was formally
included in the initial contents of the Structured Syntax Suffix Registry along with +json ,
+ber, +der, +fastinfoset , +wbxml, and +zip in January 2013 (RFC 6839).
Subsequent additions include +gzip , +cbor , +json-seq, and +cbor-seq “4!
Mailcap [eit]
Mailcap (derived from the phrase "mail capability’) is a type of meta file used to configure how
MIME-aware applications such as mail clients and web browsers render files of different MIME-
types. The mailcap format is defined by RFC 1524 "A User Agent Configuration Mechanism for
Multimedia Mail Format Information" but is not defined as an internet standard. It is supported by
most Unix systems.
Lines can be comments starting with the # character, or a mime-type followed by how to handle
that mime type.
Mime.types [exit}
‘An associated file is the mime.types file, which associates filename extensions with a MIME type.
If the MIME type is properly set, this is unnecessary, but MIME types may be incorrectly set, or set
to a generic type such as application/octet-stream , and mime.types allows one to fall
back on the extension in these cases. Similarly, since many file systems do not store MIME type
information, but instead rely on the filename extension, a mime.types file is frequently used by
web servers to determine MIME type.
When viewing a file, these two work together as follows: mime. types associates an extension
with a MIME type, while mailcap associates a MIME type with a program.
In UNIX-type systems, the mime.types file is usually located at /etc/mime.types and/or
‘SHOME/.mime.types and the format is simply that each line is a space-delimited list of a
MIME type, followed by zero or more extensions. For example, the HTML type can be associated
with the extensions .htm and html by the following line:
text/html = htm html
Netscape use [ecit]
The mime.types file dates to Netscape, where it used a different format;“*) it used key-value
pairs and a comma-separated list of extensions, together with a standard header consisting of a
specific comment that identifies the file as a mime.types file, as follows.
#--Netscape Communications Corporation MIME Information
# Do not delete the above line. It is used to identify the file
type.
type=text/html exts=htm, html

Registration trees [cit]
All media types should be registered using the IANA registration procedures. For the efficiency
and flexibility of the media type registration process, different structures of subtypes can be
registered in registration trees that are distinguished by the use of tree prefixes. Currently the
following trees are created: standard (no prefix), vendor ( vnd._ prefix), personal or vanity
(prs. prefix), unregistered ( x. prefix). These registration trees were first defined in November
1996 (obsoleted RFC 2048 - currently RFC 6838). New registration trees may be created by IETF
Standards Action for external registration and management by well-known permanent
organizations (e.g. scientific societies),
Standards tree [cit]
The standards tree does not use any tree prefix:!12]
type "/" subtype ["+" suffix] *[";" parameter]
Examples: application/javascript , image/png
Registrations in the standards tree must be either associated with IETF specifications approved
directly by the IESG, or registered by an IANA recognized standards-related organization.
Vendor tree [ecit}
The vendor tree includes media types associated with publicly available products. tt uses the
vnd. tree prefix:!2]
type "/" "vnd." subtype ["+" suffix] *[";" parameter]
Examples: application/vnd.ms-excel ,
application/vnd.oasis.opendocument .text
The terms "vendor" and "producer" are considered equivalent in the context. Industry consortia as
well as non-commercial entities can register media types in the vendor tree. A registration in the
vendor tree may be created by anyone who needs to interchange files associated with some
software product or set of products. However, the registration belongs to the vendor or
organization producing the software that employs the type being registered, and that vendor or
organization can at any time elect to assert ownership of a registration done by a third party.
Personal or vanity tree [ eit)
The personal or vanity tree includes media types associated with non publicly available products
or experimental media types. It uses the prs. tree prefix:
type "/" "prs." subtype ["+" suffix] *[";" parameter]
Examples: audio/prs.sid, image/prs.btif .
Unregistered tree [cit]
The unregistered tree includes media types intended exclusively for use in private environments
and only with the active agreement of the parties exchanging them. It uses the x. tree prefix:
type "/" "x." subtype ["+" suffix] *[";" parameter]
Examples: application/x.foo , video/x.bar .
Media types in this tree cannot be registered. According to RFC 6838 (published in January
2013), any use of types in the unregistered tree is strongly discouraged. in addition, subtypes
prefixed with x- or X- are no longer considered to be members of this tree.
According to obsoleted RFC 2048 (published in November 1996)—it should rarely, if ever, be
necessary to use unregistered types, and as such use of any x. , x- or X- prefixes is
discouraged. Obsoleted RFC 1590 (published in September 1993) stated that the use of the x-
or X- prefix may be used for unregistered subtypes.
Media types that have been widely deployed (with a subtype prefixed with x- or X- ) without
being registered, should be, if possible, re-registered with a proper prefixed subtype. If this is not
possible, the media type can, after an approval by both the media types reviewer and the IESG,
be registered in the standards tree with its unprefixed subtype.
Suffix [edit]
Suffix is an augmentation to the media type definition to additionally specify the underlying
structure of that media type, allowing for generic processing based on that structure and
independent of the exact type’s particular semantics. Media types that make use of a named
structured syntax should use the appropriate IANA registered "+"suffix for that structured
syntax when they are registered. Unregistered suffixes should not be used (since January 2013).
Structured syntax suffix registration procedures are defined in RFC 6838.02)
The +xm1_ suffix has been defined since January 2001 (RFC 3023"5!), and was formally
included in the initial contents of the Structured Syntax Suffix Registry along with +json ,
+ber, +der, +fastinfoset , +wbxml, and +zip in January 2013 (RFC 6839).
Subsequent additions include +gzip , +cbor , +json-seq, and +cbor-seq “4!
Mailcap [eit]
Mailcap (derived from the phrase "mail capability’) is a type of meta file used to configure how
MIME-aware applications such as mail clients and web browsers render files of different MIME-
types. The mailcap format is defined by RFC 1524 "A User Agent Configuration Mechanism for
Multimedia Mail Format Information" but is not defined as an internet standard. It is supported by
most Unix systems.
Lines can be comments starting with the # character, or a mime-type followed by how to handle
that mime type.
Mime.types [exit}
‘An associated file is the mime.types file, which associates filename extensions with a MIME type.
If the MIME type is properly set, this is unnecessary, but MIME types may be incorrectly set, or set
to a generic type such as application/octet-stream , and mime.types allows one to fall
back on the extension in these cases. Similarly, since many file systems do not store MIME type
information, but instead rely on the filename extension, a mime.types file is frequently used by
web servers to determine MIME type.
When viewing a file, these two work together as follows: mime. types associates an extension
with a MIME type, while mailcap associates a MIME type with a program.
In UNIX-type systems, the mime.types file is usually located at /etc/mime.types and/or
‘SHOME/.mime.types and the format is simply that each line is a space-delimited list of a
MIME type, followed by zero or more extensions. For example, the HTML type can be associated
with the extensions .htm and html by the following line:
text/html = htm html
Netscape use [ecit]
The mime.types file dates to Netscape, where it used a different format;“*) it used key-value
pairs and a comma-separated list of extensions, together with a standard header consisting of a
specific comment that identifies the file as a mime.types file, as follows.
#--Netscape Communications Corporation MIME Information
# Do not delete the above line. It is used to identify the file
type.
type=text/html exts=htm, html
