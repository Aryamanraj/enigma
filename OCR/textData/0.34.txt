2 Install
@ Bower
Ifyou are using Bower as your package manager:
bower install theia-sticky-sidebar
@NPM
Ifyou are using NPM as your package manager:
npm install theia-sticky-sidebar
@ Usage
Your website's HTML structure has to be similar to this in
order to work:
<div class="wrapper">
<div class="content">
<div class="theiaStickySidebar">
</div>
</div>
<div class="sidebar">
<div class="theiaStickySidebar">
</div>
</div>
</div>
Note that the inner "theiaStickySidebar’ divs are optional,
but highly recommended. If you don't supply them
yourself, the script will create them for you, but this can be
problematic if you're using ads or iframes, since they will
be moved around in the DOM and as a result will get
reloaded.
Note: Make sure to use <!poctyPE ntm1> in your page,
otherwise you might run into weird issues.
For the above example, you can use the following
JavaScript:
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://code. j
<script type="text/javascript" src="dist /ResizeSe
<script type="text/javascript" src="dist/theia-st
<script type="text/javascript">
JQuery (document) .ready(function() {
jQuery(".content, .sidebar').theiaStickySideb
// Settings
additionalMarginTop: 30
Yi
Yi:
</script>
@ ResizeSensor
Theia Sticky Sidebar uses the CSS Element Queries
library to detect when your sidebars change height, so
that it can recalculate their positions. This can happen if
you are using an accordion, for example.
You can choose not to include the ResizeSensor.min.js
script in your page, in which case Theia Sticky Sidebar will
continue to function (possibly even a bit smoother) but will
not automatically detect height changes.
@ Settings
@ containerSelector
The sidebar's container element. If not specified, it
defaults to the sidebar's parent.
@ additionalMarginTop
An additional top margin in pixels. Defaults to 0.
2 additionalMarginBottom
An additional bottom margin in pixels. Defaults to 0.
@ updateSidebarHeight
Updates the sidebar's height. Use this if the background
isn't showing properly, for example. Defaults to true.
2 minWidth
The sidebar returns to normal if its width is below this
value. Useful for responsive designs. Defaults to 0.
@ disableOnResponsiveLayouts
Try to detect responsive layouts automatically and disable
the sticky functionality on smaller screens. More exactly, it
detects when the container and the sidebar are moved
one on top of the other, instead of showing up side-by-
side. Defaults to true.
@ defaultPosition
The sidebar must have a non-static position , as the
inner sticky-sidebar uses position: absolute . Defaults
to relative.
? namespace
Events are binded using a namespace, so that you may
unbind them later on without affecting others. Defaults to
TSS.
