GRDDL Data Views: Getting Started, Learning More
GRPDL is a technique for gleaning resource descriptions from dialects of languages. It's a way of
extracting Semantic Web data in RDF from XML formats (especially XHTML dialects or microformats)
via transformations identified by URIs and typically expressed in XSLT. For full details, see the GRDDL
specification.
Note: The GRDDL specification is a W3C Recommendation. W3C welcomes comments
by email, especially comments that reflect implementation experience.
To use GRDDL:
A. If you're using a dialect (hDoap, Site Summaries, Embedded RDF, etc.) that already has an
established GRDDL-compatible profile:
1. Add the profile attribute:
<html xmins="nttp: //waw.w3 .org/1999/xhtmU">
<head profile="nttp: //purl.org/stuff/hdoap/profite">
<title>ty Project</title>
</head>
</ntmi>
2. Look at the data expressed as RDF using the online GRDDL demo service, and if you
like, check its output with the W3C RDF Validation service, or with a tool more
customized for your data, like the FOAF explorer.
3. Let the GRDDL Working Group know how you're using GRDDL by sending mail to the
public-grddl-comments list.

B. If you're using an XHTML dialect (Dublin Core encoding, GeoURL markup, etc.) that has an

existing transformation (dc-extract.xsl, grokGeoURL.xsl) ...
1. Make links from your XHTML data to the transformation, using the transformation link
type:
<html xmins="netp: //waw.w3..org/1999/xhemU">
<head profile="nttp://mi .W3-org/2003/g/data-view">
<tit le>Some Document</titte>
<link rel="transformation"
href="http://waw.w3 .org/2000/06/de-extract /de-extract .xsU" />
<meta name="0C-Subject"
content="ADAN; Simple Search; Index+; prototype" />
</head>
</html>
2. Reference the GRDDL profile to make it clear what that transformation link type
means:
<html xmins="netp: //waw.w3..org/1999/xhtmU">
<head profile="nttp: //mm.W3.org/2003/g/data-view">
<tit le>Some Document</title>
3. Check your data and let us know how it went as above.
Questions?

* Q: How about more complete examples?

The GRDDL primer gives a number of examples in detail. Also, a home page for Joe
Lambda shows DC, geoURL, RSS as above plus markup for FOAF (using grokFOAF.xsl)
and Creative Commons Licenses (using grokCC xsl) that you can probably figure out if you
view source.

« Q: Where can | find out about existing 'ways' rather than duplicate similar work?

A: The CustomRdfDialects wiki topic provides an informal directory of existing
conventions.

* transformation: relates a source document to a transformation, usually represented in XSLT, that
relates the source document syntax to the RDF graph syntax. domain: RootNode; range:

* namespaceTransformat.ion: relates a namespace to a transformation for all documents in that
namespace. range: Transformation

that profile. range: Transformation

in the standard RDF/XML syntax or indirectly by parsing some other dialect using a transformation
nominated by the document. domain: InformationResource; range: RDFGraph

* transformationProperty relates a transformation to the algorithm specified by the property that
computes an RDF graph from an XML document node domain: Transformation range:
TransformationProperty

documents to RDF graphs Each Transformation has at least one transformationProperty that is a
TransformationProperty.
