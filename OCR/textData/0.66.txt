History [eit]
RDFa was first proposed by Mark Birbeck in the form of a W3C note entitled XHTML and RDF,"
which was then presented to the Semantic Web Interest Group™! at the W3C's 2004 Technical
Plenary. Later that year the work became part of the sixth public Working Draft of XHTML
2.0.(51071 although it is generally assumed that RDFa was originally intended only for XHTML 2, in
fact the purpose of RDFa was always to provide a way to add a metadata to any XML-based
language. Indeed, one of the earliest documents bearing the RDF/A Syntax name has the sub-
title A collection of attributes for layering RDF on XML languages."! The document was written by
Mark Birbeck and Steven Pemberton, and was made available for discussion on October 11,
2004.
In April 2007 the XHTML 2 Working Group produced a module to support RDF annotation within
the XHTML 1 family.'°! As an example, it included an extended version of XHTML 1.1 dubbed
XHTML+RDFa 1.0. Although described as not representing an intended direction in terms of a
formal markup language from the WSC, limited use of the XHTML+RDFa 1.0 DTD did
‘subsequently appear on the public Web.2°)
October 2007 saw the first public Working Draft of a document entitled RDFa in XHTML: Syntax
and Processing." This superseded and expanded upon the April draft; it contained rules for
creating an RDFa parser, as well as guidelines for organizations wishing to make practical use of
the technology.
In October 2008 RDFa 1.0 reached recommendation status.)
RDFa 1.1 reached recommendation status in June 2012."°) It differs from RDFa 1.0 in that it no
longer relies on the XML-specific namespace mechanism. Therefore, it is possible to use RDFa
1.1 with non-XML document types such as HTML 4 or HTML 5. Details can be found in an
appendix to HTML 5.!*41
An additional RDFa 1.1 Primer document was last updated 17 March 2015.""! (The first public
Working Draft dates back to 10 March 2006.!25))
Versions and variants [edit
There are some main well-defined variants of the basic concepts, that are used as reference and
as abbreviation to the W3C standards.
HTML+RDFa [ecit]
RDFa was defined in 2008 with the "RDFa in XHTML: Syntax and Processing”
Recommendation.'“4! its first application was to be a module of XHTML.
‘The HTML applications remained, “a collection of attributes and processing rules for extending
XHTML to support RDF" expanded to HTMLS, are now expressed in a specialized standard, the
“HTML+RDFa" (the last is "HTML+RDFa 1.1 - Support for RDFa in HTML4 and HTML5"2")),
RDFa 1.0 [ait]
‘The "HTML+RDFa’ syntax of 2008 was also termed "RDFa 1.0", so, there are no "RDFa Core
1.0" standard. In general this 2008's RDFa 1.0 is used with the old XHTML standards (as long as
RDFa 1.1 is used with XHTMLS5 and HTMLS).
RDFa 1.1 [eit]
Is the first generic (for HTML and XML) RDFa standard, now (2015) the "RDFa Core 1.1" is in the
Third Edition."*)
RDFa Lite [ecit)
RDFa Lite is a W3C Recommendation (1.0 and 1.1) since 2009,""*! where it is described as
follows:
RDFa Lite is minimal subset of RDFa ... consisting of a few attributes that may be used
to express machine-readable data in Web documents like HTML, SVG, and XML. While
itis not a complete solution for advanced data markup tasks, it does work for most day-
to-day needs and can be learned by most Web authors in a day.
RDFa Lite consists of five attributes: vocab, typeof, property, resource, and prefix.!2°! RDFa 1.1
Lite is upwards compatible with RDFa 1.1.0
In 2009 the W3C was positioned“! to retain RDFa Lite as unique and definitive standard
alternative to Microdata.(22! The position was confirmed with the publication of the HTML5
Recommendation in 2014.
Essence [eait)
The essence of RDFa is to provide a set of attributes that can be used to carry metadata in an
XML language (hence the ‘a’ in RDFa).
These attributes are:
about
a URI or CURIE specifying the resource the metadata is about
reland rev
specifying a relationship and reverse-relationship with another resource, respectively
sre, href and resource
specifying the partner resource
property
specifying a property for the content of an element or the partner resource
content
optional attribute that overrides the content of the element when using the property attribute
datatype
optional attribute that specifies the datatype of text specified for use with the property attribute
typeof
optional attribute that specifies the RDF type(s) of the subject or the partner resource (the
resource that the metadata is about).
Benefits [ecit}
There are five "principles of interoperable metadata" met by RDFa.!25)
+ Publisher independence — each site can use its own standards
+ Data Reuse — data are not duplicated. Separate XML and HTML sections are not required for
the same content.
‘+ Self Containment - the HTML and the RDF are separated
+ Schema Modularity — the attributes are reusable
Additionally RDFa may benefit web accessibility as more information is available to assistive
technology.41
Usage [edit]
There is a growing number of tools for better usage of RDFa vocabularies and RDFa annotation.
HTML+RDFa statistics [exit]
Simplified approaches to semantically annotate 79% of URLs are ROFa or Microdata
information items in webpages were greatly "
encouraged by the HTML+RDFa (released in
2008) and microformats (since ~2005) ‘
standards.
As of 2013 these standards were encoding
events, contact information, products, and so
on, Despite the vCard semantics (only basic
49% of domains are ROFa or Microdata
items of person and organization annotations)
dominance,*! and some cloning of annotations
along the same domain, the counting of 4
webpages (URLs) and domains with
annotations is an important statistical indicator
for usage of semantically annotated information
in the Web.
The statistics of 2017 show that usage”®! of 2013 survey pizza charts of percentage a
HTML#RDFa is now less than that of usage, showing that 7996 of URLs and 4396 of
f domains use HTML+RDFa. The average 61% (the
Microformats. ‘other 39% was Microformats) is the usage
indicator.
RDFa editors [exit]
Web-based RDFa editors
There are already a few RDFa editors available online. RDFaCE (RDFa Content Editor) is a
WYSIWYM editor based on TinyMCE to support RDFa content authoring. It supports manual
and semi-automatic generation of RDFa with the support of annotation services such as
DBpedia Spotlight, OpenCalais, Alchemy API, among others.27] RDFaCE-Lite is a version of
RDFaCE also supporting Microdata and available as a WordPress plugin.°!
Desktop RDFa editors
AutéMeta is an environment for semi-automatic (or automatic) annotation of documents for
publishing on the Web using RDFa. It also includes a RDFa extraction tool to provide the user
with a view of the annotated triples. It is available in both CLI and GUI interfaces.'2°!
Examples [ecit)
The following is an example of adding Dublin Core metadata to an XML element in an XHTML file.
Dublin Core data elements are data typically added to a book or article (title, author, subject etc.)
<div xmlns:de="http://purl.org/de/elements/1.1/"
about="http://www. example. com/books/wikinomics">
<span property="dc: tit le">Wikinomics</span>
<span property="de:creator">Don Tapscot t</span>
<span property="de:date">2006-10-01</span>
</div>
Moreover, RDFa allows the passages and words within a text to be associated with semantic
markup:
<div xmlns:de="http://purl.org/de/elements/1.1/"
about="http://www. example. com/books/wikinomics">
In his latest book
<span property="dc: tit le">Wikinomics</span>,
<span property="de:creator">Don Tapscott</span>
explains deep changes in technology,
demographics and business.
The book is due to be published in
<span property="de:date" content="2006-10-01">0ctober 2006</span>.
</div>
XHTML + RDFa 1.0 [ecit]
The following is an example of a complete XHTML+RDFa 1.0 document. It uses Dublin Core and
FOAF, an ontology for describing people and their relationships with other people and things:
<?xml _version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"2>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML+RDFa 1.0//EN"
"http: //www.w3.org/MarkUp/DTD/xhtml-rdfa-1.dtd">
<html xmLns="http: //www.w3.org/1999/xhtmL"
xmlns: foaf="http://xmLns .com/foaf/0.1/"
xmlns:de="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
version="XHTML+RDFa 1.0" xml: lang="en">
<head>
<title>John's Home Page</title>
<base href="http://example.org/john-d/" />
<meta property="de:creator" content="Jonathan Doe" />
<link rel="foaf:primaryTopic" href="http://example.org/john-
d/#me" />
</head>
<body about="http://example.org/john-d/#me">
<h1>John's Home Page</h1>
<p>My name is <span property="foaf:nick">John D</span> and I
Like
<a href="http://waw.neubauten.org/" rel="foaf:interest"
xmL: lang="de">Einsttrzende Neubauten</a>.
</p>
<p>
My <span rel="foaf: interest"
resource="urn: ISBN: 0752820907">favorite
book is the inspiring <span about="urn:ISBN:0752820907"><cite
property="de:title">Weaving the Web</cite> by
<span property="de:creator">Tim Berners-Lee</span></span>
</span>.
</p>
</body>
</html>
In the example above, the document URI can be seen as representing an HTML document, but
the document URI plus the "#me" string http://example.org/john-d/#me represents the
actual person, as distinct from a document about them. The foaf:primaryTopic in the header tells
Us a URI of the person the document is about. The foaf:nick property (in the first span element)
contains a nickname for this person, and the de:creator property (in the meta element) tells us
who created the document. The hyperlink to the Einstirzende Neubauten website contains
rel="foaf: interest" , suggesting that John Doe is interested in this band. The URI of their
website is a resource.
The foafiinterest inside the second p elements referring to a book by ISBN number. The
resource attribute defines a resource in a similar way to the href attribute, but without
defining a hyperlink. Further into the paragraph, a span element containing an about attribute
defines the book as another resource to specify metadata about. The book title and author are
defined within the contents of this tag using the de:ttle and de:creator properties.
Here are the same triples when the above document is automatically converted to RDF/XML:
<?xml _version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"2>
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
xmlns: foaf="http://xmLns .com/foaf/0.1/"
xmlns:de="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">
<rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/john-d/">
<de:creator xml: lang="en">Jonathan Doe</dc:creator>
<foaf : primaryTopic>
<rdf Description rdf:about="http://example.org/john-d/#me">
<foaf:nick xml: lang="en">John D</foaf:nick>
<foaf: interest rdf:resource="http://www.neubauten.org/"/>
<foaf:interest>
<rdf:Description rdf:about="urn: ISBN:0752820907">
<de:creator xml: lang="en">Tim Berners-Lee</de:creator>
<de:title xml: lang="en">Weaving the Web</de:title>
</rdf :Description>
</foaf :interest>
</rdf :Description>
</foaf :primaryTopic>
</rdf :Description>
</rdf :RDF>
HTMLS +RDFa 1.1 [exit]
The above example can be expressed without XML namespaces in HTMLS:
<html prefix="de: http://purl.org/de/elements/1.1/" lang="en">
<head>
<title>John's Home Page</title>
<link rel="profile" href="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab" />
<base href="http://example.org/john-d/" />
<meta property="de:creator" content="Jonathan Doe" />
<link rel="foaf:primaryTopic" href="http://example.org/john-
d/#me" />
</head>
<body about="http://example.org/john-d/#me">
<hi>John's Home Page</h1>
<p>My name is <span property="foaf:nick">John D</span> and I
Like
<a href="http://www.neubauten.org/" rel="foaf:interest"
lang="de">Einstirzende Neubauten</a>.
</p>
<p>
My <span rel="foaf: interest"
resource="urn: ISBN: 0752820907">favorite
book is the inspiring <span about="urn:ISBN:0752820907"><cite
property="de:title">Weaving the Web</cite> by
<span property="de:creator">Tim Berners-Lee</span></span>
</span>.
</p>
</body>
</html>
Note how the prefix foaf is still used without declaration. RDFa 1.1 automatically includes prefixes
for popular vocabularies such as FOAF.S°)
The minimal '*! document is:
<html Lang="en">
<head>
<title>Example Document</title>
</head>
<body vocab="http://schema.org/">
<p typeof="Blog">
Welcome to my <a property="url"
href="http: //example.org/">blog</a>.
</p>
</body>
</html>
That is, itis recommended that all of these attributes are used: vocab , typeof , property ;
not only one of them.

HTML+RDFa [ecit]
RDFa was defined in 2008 with the "RDFa in XHTML: Syntax and Processing”
Recommendation.'“4! its first application was to be a module of XHTML.
‘The HTML applications remained, “a collection of attributes and processing rules for extending

RDFa 1.1 is used with XHTMLS5 and HTMLS).
RDFa 1.1 [eit]
Is the first generic (for HTML and XML) RDFa standard, now (2015) the "RDFa Core 1.1" is in the
Third Edition."*)
RDFa Lite [ecit)
RDFa Lite is a W3C Recommendation (1.0 and 1.1) since 2009,""*! where it is described as
follows:
RDFa Lite is minimal subset of RDFa ... consisting of a few attributes that may be used
to express machine-readable data in Web documents like HTML, SVG, and XML. While
itis not a complete solution for advanced data markup tasks, it does work for most day-
to-day needs and can be learned by most Web authors in a day.
RDFa Lite consists of five attributes: vocab, typeof, property, resource, and prefix.!2°! RDFa 1.1
Lite is upwards compatible with RDFa 1.1.0
In 2009 the W3C was positioned“! to retain RDFa Lite as unique and definitive standard
alternative to Microdata.(22! The position was confirmed with the publication of the HTML5
Recommendation in 2014.
Essence [eait)
The essence of RDFa is to provide a set of attributes that can be used to carry metadata in an
XML language (hence the ‘a’ in RDFa).
These attributes are:
about
a URI or CURIE specifying the resource the metadata is about
reland rev
specifying a relationship and reverse-relationship with another resource, respectively
sre, href and resource
specifying the partner resource
property
specifying a property for the content of an element or the partner resource
content
optional attribute that overrides the content of the element when using the property attribute
datatype
optional attribute that specifies the datatype of text specified for use with the property attribute
typeof
optional attribute that specifies the RDF type(s) of the subject or the partner resource (the
resource that the metadata is about).
Benefits [ecit}
There are five "principles of interoperable metadata" met by RDFa.!25)
+ Publisher independence — each site can use its own standards
+ Data Reuse — data are not duplicated. Separate XML and HTML sections are not required for
the same content.
‘+ Self Containment - the HTML and the RDF are separated
+ Schema Modularity — the attributes are reusable
Additionally RDFa may benefit web accessibility as more information is available to assistive
technology.41
Usage [edit]
There is a growing number of tools for better usage of RDFa vocabularies and RDFa annotation.
HTML+RDFa statistics [exit]
Simplified approaches to semantically annotate 79% of URLs are ROFa or Microdata
information items in webpages were greatly "
encouraged by the HTML+RDFa (released in
2008) and microformats (since ~2005) ‘
standards.
As of 2013 these standards were encoding
events, contact information, products, and so
on, Despite the vCard semantics (only basic
49% of domains are ROFa or Microdata
items of person and organization annotations)
dominance,*! and some cloning of annotations
along the same domain, the counting of 4
webpages (URLs) and domains with
annotations is an important statistical indicator
for usage of semantically annotated information
in the Web.
The statistics of 2017 show that usage”®! of 2013 survey pizza charts of percentage a
HTML#RDFa is now less than that of usage, showing that 7996 of URLs and 4396 of
f domains use HTML+RDFa. The average 61% (the
Microformats. ‘other 39% was Microformats) is the usage
indicator.
RDFa editors [exit]
Web-based RDFa editors
There are already a few RDFa editors available online. RDFaCE (RDFa Content Editor) is a
WYSIWYM editor based on TinyMCE to support RDFa content authoring. It supports manual
and semi-automatic generation of RDFa with the support of annotation services such as
DBpedia Spotlight, OpenCalais, Alchemy API, among others.27] RDFaCE-Lite is a version of
RDFaCE also supporting Microdata and available as a WordPress plugin.°!
Desktop RDFa editors
AutéMeta is an environment for semi-automatic (or automatic) annotation of documents for
publishing on the Web using RDFa. It also includes a RDFa extraction tool to provide the user
with a view of the annotated triples. It is available in both CLI and GUI interfaces.'2°!
Examples [ecit)
The following is an example of adding Dublin Core metadata to an XML element in an XHTML file.
Dublin Core data elements are data typically added to a book or article (title, author, subject etc.)
<div xmlns:de="http://purl.org/de/elements/1.1/"
about="http://www. example. com/books/wikinomics">
<span property="dc: tit le">Wikinomics</span>
<span property="de:creator">Don Tapscot t</span>
<span property="de:date">2006-10-01</span>
</div>
Moreover, RDFa allows the passages and words within a text to be associated with semantic
markup:
<div xmlns:de="http://purl.org/de/elements/1.1/"
about="http://www. example. com/books/wikinomics">
In his latest book
<span property="dc: tit le">Wikinomics</span>,
<span property="de:creator">Don Tapscott</span>
explains deep changes in technology,
demographics and business.
The book is due to be published in
<span property="de:date" content="2006-10-01">0ctober 2006</span>.
</div>
XHTML + RDFa 1.0 [ecit]
The following is an example of a complete XHTML+RDFa 1.0 document. It uses Dublin Core and
FOAF, an ontology for describing people and their relationships with other people and things:
<?xml _version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"2>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML+RDFa 1.0//EN"
"http: //www.w3.org/MarkUp/DTD/xhtml-rdfa-1.dtd">
<html xmLns="http: //www.w3.org/1999/xhtmL"
xmlns: foaf="http://xmLns .com/foaf/0.1/"
xmlns:de="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
version="XHTML+RDFa 1.0" xml: lang="en">
<head>
<title>John's Home Page</title>
<base href="http://example.org/john-d/" />
<meta property="de:creator" content="Jonathan Doe" />
<link rel="foaf:primaryTopic" href="http://example.org/john-
d/#me" />
</head>
<body about="http://example.org/john-d/#me">
<h1>John's Home Page</h1>
<p>My name is <span property="foaf:nick">John D</span> and I
Like
<a href="http://waw.neubauten.org/" rel="foaf:interest"
xmL: lang="de">Einsttrzende Neubauten</a>.
</p>
<p>
My <span rel="foaf: interest"
resource="urn: ISBN: 0752820907">favorite
book is the inspiring <span about="urn:ISBN:0752820907"><cite
property="de:title">Weaving the Web</cite> by
<span property="de:creator">Tim Berners-Lee</span></span>
</span>.
</p>
</body>
</html>
In the example above, the document URI can be seen as representing an HTML document, but
the document URI plus the "#me" string http://example.org/john-d/#me represents the
actual person, as distinct from a document about them. The foaf:primaryTopic in the header tells
Us a URI of the person the document is about. The foaf:nick property (in the first span element)
contains a nickname for this person, and the de:creator property (in the meta element) tells us
who created the document. The hyperlink to the Einstirzende Neubauten website contains
rel="foaf: interest" , suggesting that John Doe is interested in this band. The URI of their
website is a resource.
The foafiinterest inside the second p elements referring to a book by ISBN number. The
resource attribute defines a resource in a similar way to the href attribute, but without
defining a hyperlink. Further into the paragraph, a span element containing an about attribute
defines the book as another resource to specify metadata about. The book title and author are
defined within the contents of this tag using the de:ttle and de:creator properties.
Here are the same triples when the above document is automatically converted to RDF/XML:
<?xml _version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"2>
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"

<foaf : primaryTopic>
<rdf Description rdf:about="http://example.org/john-d/#me">
<foaf:nick xml: lang="en">John D</foaf:nick>
<foaf: interest rdf:resource="http://www.neubauten.org/"/>
<foaf:interest>

</rdf :Description>
</foaf :interest>
</rdf :Description>
</foaf :primaryTopic>
</rdf :Description>
</rdf :RDF>
HTMLS +RDFa 1.1 [exit]
The above example can be expressed without XML namespaces in HTMLS:
<html prefix="de: http://purl.org/de/elements/1.1/" lang="en">
<head>
<title>John's Home Page</title>
<link rel="profile" href="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab" />
<base href="http://example.org/john-d/" />
<meta property="de:creator" content="Jonathan Doe" />
<link rel="foaf:primaryTopic" href="http://example.org/john-

</head>
<body about="http://example.org/john-d/#me">
<hi>John's Home Page</h1>
<p>My name is <span property="foaf:nick">John D</span> and I
Like
<a href="http://www.neubauten.org/" rel="foaf:interest"
lang="de">Einstirzende Neubauten</a>.

property="de:title">Weaving the Web</cite> by
<span property="de:creator">Tim Berners-Lee</span></span>
</span>.
</p>
</body>
</html>
Note how the prefix foaf is still used without declaration. RDFa 1.1 automatically includes prefixes
for popular vocabularies such as FOAF.S°)
The minimal '*! document is:
<html Lang="en">
<head>
<title>Example Document</title>
</head>
<body vocab="http://schema.org/">
<p typeof="Blog">
Welcome to my <a property="url"
href="http: //example.org/">blog</a>.
</p>
</body>
</html>
That is, itis recommended that all of these attributes are used: vocab , typeof , property ;
not only one of them.

History [eit]
RDFa was first proposed by Mark Birbeck in the form of a W3C note entitled XHTML and RDF,"
which was then presented to the Semantic Web Interest Group™! at the W3C's 2004 Technical
Plenary. Later that year the work became part of the sixth public Working Draft of XHTML
2.0.(51071 although it is generally assumed that RDFa was originally intended only for XHTML 2, in
fact the purpose of RDFa was always to provide a way to add a metadata to any XML-based
language. Indeed, one of the earliest documents bearing the RDF/A Syntax name has the sub-
title A collection of attributes for layering RDF on XML languages."! The document was written by
Mark Birbeck and Steven Pemberton, and was made available for discussion on October 11,
2004.
In April 2007 the XHTML 2 Working Group produced a module to support RDF annotation within
the XHTML 1 family.'°! As an example, it included an extended version of XHTML 1.1 dubbed
XHTML+RDFa 1.0. Although described as not representing an intended direction in terms of a
formal markup language from the WSC, limited use of the XHTML+RDFa 1.0 DTD did
‘subsequently appear on the public Web.2°)
October 2007 saw the first public Working Draft of a document entitled RDFa in XHTML: Syntax
and Processing." This superseded and expanded upon the April draft; it contained rules for
creating an RDFa parser, as well as guidelines for organizations wishing to make practical use of
the technology.
In October 2008 RDFa 1.0 reached recommendation status.)
RDFa 1.1 reached recommendation status in June 2012."°) It differs from RDFa 1.0 in that it no
longer relies on the XML-specific namespace mechanism. Therefore, it is possible to use RDFa
1.1 with non-XML document types such as HTML 4 or HTML 5. Details can be found in an
appendix to HTML 5.!*41
An additional RDFa 1.1 Primer document was last updated 17 March 2015.""! (The first public
Working Draft dates back to 10 March 2006.!25))
Versions and variants [edit
There are some main well-defined variants of the basic concepts, that are used as reference and
as abbreviation to the W3C standards.
HTML+RDFa [ecit]
RDFa was defined in 2008 with the "RDFa in XHTML: Syntax and Processing”
Recommendation.'“4! its first application was to be a module of XHTML.
‘The HTML applications remained, “a collection of attributes and processing rules for extending
XHTML to support RDF" expanded to HTMLS, are now expressed in a specialized standard, the
“HTML+RDFa" (the last is "HTML+RDFa 1.1 - Support for RDFa in HTML4 and HTML5"2")),
RDFa 1.0 [ait]
‘The "HTML+RDFa’ syntax of 2008 was also termed "RDFa 1.0", so, there are no "RDFa Core
1.0" standard. In general this 2008's RDFa 1.0 is used with the old XHTML standards (as long as
RDFa 1.1 is used with XHTMLS5 and HTMLS).
RDFa 1.1 [eit]
Is the first generic (for HTML and XML) RDFa standard, now (2015) the "RDFa Core 1.1" is in the
Third Edition."*)
RDFa Lite [ecit)
RDFa Lite is a W3C Recommendation (1.0 and 1.1) since 2009,""*! where it is described as
follows:
RDFa Lite is minimal subset of RDFa ... consisting of a few attributes that may be used
to express machine-readable data in Web documents like HTML, SVG, and XML. While
itis not a complete solution for advanced data markup tasks, it does work for most day-
to-day needs and can be learned by most Web authors in a day.
RDFa Lite consists of five attributes: vocab, typeof, property, resource, and prefix.!2°! RDFa 1.1
Lite is upwards compatible with RDFa 1.1.0
In 2009 the W3C was positioned“! to retain RDFa Lite as unique and definitive standard
alternative to Microdata.(22! The position was confirmed with the publication of the HTML5
Recommendation in 2014.
Essence [eait)
The essence of RDFa is to provide a set of attributes that can be used to carry metadata in an
XML language (hence the ‘a’ in RDFa).
These attributes are:
about
a URI or CURIE specifying the resource the metadata is about
reland rev
specifying a relationship and reverse-relationship with another resource, respectively
sre, href and resource
specifying the partner resource
property
specifying a property for the content of an element or the partner resource
content
optional attribute that overrides the content of the element when using the property attribute
datatype
optional attribute that specifies the datatype of text specified for use with the property attribute
typeof
optional attribute that specifies the RDF type(s) of the subject or the partner resource (the
resource that the metadata is about).
Benefits [ecit}
There are five "principles of interoperable metadata" met by RDFa.!25)
+ Publisher independence — each site can use its own standards
+ Data Reuse — data are not duplicated. Separate XML and HTML sections are not required for
the same content.
‘+ Self Containment - the HTML and the RDF are separated
+ Schema Modularity — the attributes are reusable
Additionally RDFa may benefit web accessibility as more information is available to assistive
technology.41
Usage [edit]
There is a growing number of tools for better usage of RDFa vocabularies and RDFa annotation.

XHTML + RDFa 1.0 [ecit]
The following is an example of a complete XHTML+RDFa 1.0 document. It uses Dublin Core and
FOAF, an ontology for describing people and their relationships with other people and things:
<?xml _version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"2>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML+RDFa 1.0//EN"
"http: //www.w3.org/MarkUp/DTD/xhtml-rdfa-1.dtd">

version="XHTML+RDFa 1.0" xml: lang="en">
<head>
<title>John's Home Page</title>
<base href="http://example.org/john-d/" />
<meta property="de:creator" content="Jonathan Doe" />
<link rel="foaf:primaryTopic" href="http://example.org/john-

</head>
<body about="http://example.org/john-d/#me">
<h1>John's Home Page</h1>
<p>My name is <span property="foaf:nick">John D</span> and I

</span>.
</p>
</body>
</html>
In the example above, the document URI can be seen as representing an HTML document, but
the document URI plus the "#me" string http://example.org/john-d/#me represents the
actual person, as distinct from a document about them. The foaf:primaryTopic in the header tells
Us a URI of the person the document is about. The foaf:nick property (in the first span element)
contains a nickname for this person, and the de:creator property (in the meta element) tells us
who created the document. The hyperlink to the Einstirzende Neubauten website contains
rel="foaf: interest" , suggesting that John Doe is interested in this band. The URI of their
website is a resource.
The foafiinterest inside the second p elements referring to a book by ISBN number. The
resource attribute defines a resource in a similar way to the href attribute, but without
defining a hyperlink. Further into the paragraph, a span element containing an about attribute
defines the book as another resource to specify metadata about. The book title and author are
defined within the contents of this tag using the de:ttle and de:creator properties.
Here are the same triples when the above document is automatically converted to RDF/XML:
<?xml _version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"2>

Note how the prefix foaf is still used without declaration. RDFa 1.1 automatically includes prefixes
for popular vocabularies such as FOAF.S°)
The minimal '*! document is:

That is, itis recommended that all of these attributes are used: vocab , typeof , property ;
not only one of them.

History [eit]
RDFa was first proposed by Mark Birbeck in the form of a W3C note entitled XHTML and RDF,"
which was then presented to the Semantic Web Interest Group™! at the W3C's 2004 Technical
Plenary. Later that year the work became part of the sixth public Working Draft of XHTML
2.0.(51071 although it is generally assumed that RDFa was originally intended only for XHTML 2, in
fact the purpose of RDFa was always to provide a way to add a metadata to any XML-based
language. Indeed, one of the earliest documents bearing the RDF/A Syntax name has the sub-
title A collection of attributes for layering RDF on XML languages."! The document was written by
Mark Birbeck and Steven Pemberton, and was made available for discussion on October 11,
2004.
In April 2007 the XHTML 2 Working Group produced a module to support RDF annotation within
the XHTML 1 family.'°! As an example, it included an extended version of XHTML 1.1 dubbed
XHTML+RDFa 1.0. Although described as not representing an intended direction in terms of a
formal markup language from the WSC, limited use of the XHTML+RDFa 1.0 DTD did
‘subsequently appear on the public Web.2°)
October 2007 saw the first public Working Draft of a document entitled RDFa in XHTML: Syntax
and Processing." This superseded and expanded upon the April draft; it contained rules for
creating an RDFa parser, as well as guidelines for organizations wishing to make practical use of
the technology.
In October 2008 RDFa 1.0 reached recommendation status.)
RDFa 1.1 reached recommendation status in June 2012."°) It differs from RDFa 1.0 in that it no
longer relies on the XML-specific namespace mechanism. Therefore, it is possible to use RDFa
1.1 with non-XML document types such as HTML 4 or HTML 5. Details can be found in an
appendix to HTML 5.!*41
An additional RDFa 1.1 Primer document was last updated 17 March 2015.""! (The first public
Working Draft dates back to 10 March 2006.!25))
Versions and variants [edit
There are some main well-defined variants of the basic concepts, that are used as reference and
as abbreviation to the W3C standards.
HTML+RDFa [ecit]
RDFa was defined in 2008 with the "RDFa in XHTML: Syntax and Processing”
Recommendation.'“4! its first application was to be a module of XHTML.
‘The HTML applications remained, “a collection of attributes and processing rules for extending
XHTML to support RDF" expanded to HTMLS, are now expressed in a specialized standard, the
“HTML+RDFa" (the last is "HTML+RDFa 1.1 - Support for RDFa in HTML4 and HTML5"2")),
RDFa 1.0 [ait]
‘The "HTML+RDFa’ syntax of 2008 was also termed "RDFa 1.0", so, there are no "RDFa Core
1.0" standard. In general this 2008's RDFa 1.0 is used with the old XHTML standards (as long as
RDFa 1.1 is used with XHTMLS5 and HTMLS).
RDFa 1.1 [eit]
Is the first generic (for HTML and XML) RDFa standard, now (2015) the "RDFa Core 1.1" is in the
Third Edition."*)
RDFa Lite [ecit)
RDFa Lite is a W3C Recommendation (1.0 and 1.1) since 2009,""*! where it is described as
follows:
RDFa Lite is minimal subset of RDFa ... consisting of a few attributes that may be used
to express machine-readable data in Web documents like HTML, SVG, and XML. While
itis not a complete solution for advanced data markup tasks, it does work for most day-
to-day needs and can be learned by most Web authors in a day.
RDFa Lite consists of five attributes: vocab, typeof, property, resource, and prefix.!2°! RDFa 1.1
Lite is upwards compatible with RDFa 1.1.0
In 2009 the W3C was positioned“! to retain RDFa Lite as unique and definitive standard
alternative to Microdata.(22! The position was confirmed with the publication of the HTML5
Recommendation in 2014.
Essence [eait)
The essence of RDFa is to provide a set of attributes that can be used to carry metadata in an
XML language (hence the ‘a’ in RDFa).
These attributes are:
about
a URI or CURIE specifying the resource the metadata is about
reland rev
specifying a relationship and reverse-relationship with another resource, respectively
sre, href and resource
specifying the partner resource
property
specifying a property for the content of an element or the partner resource
content
optional attribute that overrides the content of the element when using the property attribute
datatype
optional attribute that specifies the datatype of text specified for use with the property attribute
typeof
optional attribute that specifies the RDF type(s) of the subject or the partner resource (the
resource that the metadata is about).
Benefits [ecit}
There are five "principles of interoperable metadata" met by RDFa.!25)
+ Publisher independence — each site can use its own standards
+ Data Reuse — data are not duplicated. Separate XML and HTML sections are not required for
the same content.
‘+ Self Containment - the HTML and the RDF are separated
+ Schema Modularity — the attributes are reusable
Additionally RDFa may benefit web accessibility as more information is available to assistive
technology.41
Usage [edit]
There is a growing number of tools for better usage of RDFa vocabularies and RDFa annotation.
HTML+RDFa statistics [exit]
Simplified approaches to semantically annotate 79% of URLs are ROFa or Microdata
information items in webpages were greatly "
encouraged by the HTML+RDFa (released in
2008) and microformats (since ~2005) ‘
standards.
As of 2013 these standards were encoding
events, contact information, products, and so
on, Despite the vCard semantics (only basic
49% of domains are ROFa or Microdata
items of person and organization annotations)
dominance,*! and some cloning of annotations
along the same domain, the counting of 4
webpages (URLs) and domains with
annotations is an important statistical indicator
for usage of semantically annotated information
in the Web.
The statistics of 2017 show that usage”®! of 2013 survey pizza charts of percentage a
HTML#RDFa is now less than that of usage, showing that 7996 of URLs and 4396 of
f domains use HTML+RDFa. The average 61% (the
Microformats. ‘other 39% was Microformats) is the usage
indicator.
RDFa editors [exit]
Web-based RDFa editors
There are already a few RDFa editors available online. RDFaCE (RDFa Content Editor) is a
WYSIWYM editor based on TinyMCE to support RDFa content authoring. It supports manual
and semi-automatic generation of RDFa with the support of annotation services such as
DBpedia Spotlight, OpenCalais, Alchemy API, among others.27] RDFaCE-Lite is a version of
RDFaCE also supporting Microdata and available as a WordPress plugin.°!
Desktop RDFa editors
AutéMeta is an environment for semi-automatic (or automatic) annotation of documents for
publishing on the Web using RDFa. It also includes a RDFa extraction tool to provide the user
with a view of the annotated triples. It is available in both CLI and GUI interfaces.'2°!
Examples [ecit)
The following is an example of adding Dublin Core metadata to an XML element in an XHTML file.
Dublin Core data elements are data typically added to a book or article (title, author, subject etc.)
<div xmlns:de="http://purl.org/de/elements/1.1/"
about="http://www. example. com/books/wikinomics">
<span property="dc: tit le">Wikinomics</span>
<span property="de:creator">Don Tapscot t</span>
<span property="de:date">2006-10-01</span>
</div>
Moreover, RDFa allows the passages and words within a text to be associated with semantic
markup:
<div xmlns:de="http://purl.org/de/elements/1.1/"
about="http://www. example. com/books/wikinomics">
In his latest book
<span property="dc: tit le">Wikinomics</span>,
<span property="de:creator">Don Tapscott</span>
explains deep changes in technology,
demographics and business.
The book is due to be published in
<span property="de:date" content="2006-10-01">0ctober 2006</span>.
</div>
XHTML + RDFa 1.0 [ecit]
The following is an example of a complete XHTML+RDFa 1.0 document. It uses Dublin Core and
FOAF, an ontology for describing people and their relationships with other people and things:
<?xml _version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"2>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML+RDFa 1.0//EN"

</head>
<body about="http://example.org/john-d/#me">

</p>
</body>
</html>
In the example above, the document URI can be seen as representing an HTML document, but
the document URI plus the "#me" string http://example.org/john-d/#me represents the
actual person, as distinct from a document about them. The foaf:primaryTopic in the header tells
Us a URI of the person the document is about. The foaf:nick property (in the first span element)
contains a nickname for this person, and the de:creator property (in the meta element) tells us
who created the document. The hyperlink to the Einstirzende Neubauten website contains
rel="foaf: interest" , suggesting that John Doe is interested in this band. The URI of their
website is a resource.
The foafiinterest inside the second p elements referring to a book by ISBN number. The
resource attribute defines a resource in a similar way to the href attribute, but without
defining a hyperlink. Further into the paragraph, a span element containing an about attribute
defines the book as another resource to specify metadata about. The book title and author are
defined within the contents of this tag using the de:ttle and de:creator properties.
Here are the same triples when the above document is automatically converted to RDF/XML:

Note how the prefix foaf is still used without declaration. RDFa 1.1 automatically includes prefixes
for popular vocabularies such as FOAF.S°)
The minimal '*! document is:
<html Lang="en">
<head>
<title>Example Document</title>
</head>
<body vocab="http://schema.org/">
<p typeof="Blog">
Welcome to my <a property="url"
href="http: //example.org/">blog</a>.
</p>
</body>
</html>
That is, itis recommended that all of these attributes are used: vocab , typeof , property ;
not only one of them.
