Aminimal, tiny jQuery plugin that will generate a table of
contents, drawing from headings on the page. Languages
The generated TOCs are semantic, nested lists (ut or —
ol) with hash-link anchors to the headings. © JavaScript 100.0%
@ Usage
You can download the latest release, or install with NPM:
npm install jquery. toc
Include jQuery (>= 1.6) and jquery.toc js/jquery.toc.min.js
on your page. The plugin can then be used either via
HTMLS data attributes, or via the programmatic API. See
below for the available options.
@ Via data attributes
Minimal example:
<ul data-toc></ul>
With options:
<ol data-toc="div.container" data-toc-headings="h
@ Via the JavaScript programmatic API
Minimal example:
<ul id="toc"></ul>
<script type="text/javascript">
S("#toc"). toc();
</script>
With options:
<ul id="toc"></ul>
<script type="text/javascript">
$("#toc").toc({eontent: "div.container", head
</script>
2 Options
<ul data-toc="content" data-toc-headings="heading
S(...).toc({content: "body", headings: "hi, h2,h3"
The plugin has two options:
* content is a selector where the plugin will look for
headings to build up the TOC. The default value is
"body" .
* headings isa string with a comma-separated list of
selectors to be used as headings, in the order which
defines their relative hierarchy level. The default
value of “ha,h2,n3" will select all na, n2, and ng
elements to build the TOC, with ha being a level 1,
h2 a level 2, and so on. You can use any valid list of
iQuery selectors; for example, if you just want na
tags with a specific class, and no ng tags, you could
use “n1.title,n2" for this parameter.
In addition, the plugin will create nested lists of the same
type (ut or ot) as the element that it is called on.
@ Automatic ID generation
The plugin generates hash-links to the headings on the
page, to allow users to jump to the heading by clicking in
the generated table of contents. This feature requires that
the headings have IDs assigned; if they do not, the plugin
will generate and assign IDs automatically.
The generated IDs are based on the text inside the
headings, and uses two simple rules:
+ Space characters are converted to underscores.
Multiple spaces are replaced with a single
underscore.
* Ifthe ID already exists, a suffix like "_1","_2", ete. is
tried till we get a unique ID.
For example, a heading like <h2>Heading 2.1</n2> will
get the ID Heading 2.1.
Alternatives
If you're looking for a jQuery plugin that does more than
just generate a minimal table of contents, the project wiki
lists some more plugins.
